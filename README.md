# Quick Intro

1. Use QT5 and mingw-32 to compile the project. mvcc doesnt work for some reason. 64 bit as well screwed up.
2. Disable shadow build and build in project/release dir
3. Network code is not guranteed to be working.
4. Saving of files can be broken
5. development stopped back in 2016, and god knows what is there now.
6. Author is not responsible for mental damage caused by looking at or reading the code. You have been warned!

#Building
see this: https://wiki.qt.io/Deploy_an_Application_on_Windows

# Shortcuts:
try using keys like Shift, ctrl, alt, tab.
most of the control is on them.

# App history
Initially it started as one of those mega projects to conquer world, but you know how this ends.
In the end i got a pretty fast painting tool with replayability and network comms, and tons of bugs.

# App future
I may remake it under unity or other gpu based stuff, someday, maybe even in another life or universe.
